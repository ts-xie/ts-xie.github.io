      <description>Tom started programming since he&amp;rsquo;s 14 and he loves it ever since.
Tom knows things. He knows things in and out. He likes to quote from Richard Feynman &amp;ldquo;What I cannot create, I do not understand&amp;rdquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s really hard to ask a question that he cannot answer, if that happens, he always dig into it and find the answer eventually.
Tom knows a lot of things. He always stay curious about the world.</description>
