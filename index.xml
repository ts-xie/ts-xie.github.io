      <description>Intro D3.js has simple but powerful APIs that allows us to do data driven development, creating and modifying DOM elements based on data change. All thanks to the design of D3 selection and data join. Here I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how D3 data join works behind the scenes. Also check out Thinking with Joins, a great explanation from Mike Bostock, if you haven&amp;rsquo;t yet.
Selection A selection is groups of selected elements.</description>

      <description>Tom started programming since he&amp;rsquo;s 14 and he loves it ever since.
Tom knows things. He knows things in and out. He likes to quote from Richard Feynman &amp;ldquo;What I cannot create, I do not understand&amp;rdquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s really hard to ask a question that he cannot answer, if that happens, he always dig into it and find the answer eventually.
Tom knows a lot of things. He always stay curious about the world.</description>
