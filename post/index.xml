      <description>Personally, I don’t mind to switch frameworks because each one has its pros and cons, and I always like to try new techs and learn from it. I’ve used jQuery, Backbone, Angular1, Vue.js so far, and really you can see how frontend evolve so fast and those frameworks and concepts make frontend development much easier than before.
Angular is a great framework and introduced two day data binding, dependency injection, modularization etc.</description>

      <description>JWT went really hot since introduced and many companies has adopt it and so do we. When I first looked at JWT, the selling points feels so right that can magically solve our problems, but the reality doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem so.
It took me few weeks to make the transition from old fashion session cookie to JWT authentication, but the process is pretty smooth. We were pretty happy with the result until we want to invalidate a single token.</description>

      <description>Intro D3.js has simple but powerful APIs that allows us to do data driven development, creating and modifying DOM elements based on data change. All thanks to the design of D3 selection and data join. Here I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how D3 data join works behind the scenes. Also check out Thinking with Joins, a great explanation from Mike Bostock, if you haven&amp;rsquo;t yet.
Selection A selection is groups of selected elements.</description>

      <description>Tom started programming since he&amp;rsquo;s 14 and he loves it ever since.
Tom knows things. He knows things in and out. He likes to quote from Richard Feynman &amp;ldquo;What I cannot create, I do not understand&amp;rdquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s really hard to ask a question that he cannot answer, if that happens, he always dig into it and find the answer eventually.
Tom knows a lot of things. He always stay curious about the world.</description>
