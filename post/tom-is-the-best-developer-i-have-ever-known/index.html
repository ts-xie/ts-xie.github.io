    <h4><a href="/post/tom-is-the-best-developer-i-have-ever-known/">Tom Is the Best Developer I Have Ever Known</a></h4>
    <h5>May 30, 2018</h5>
    

</div>


    <br> <div class="text-justify"><p>Tom started programming when he&rsquo;s 14 and he loved it ever since.</p>

<p>Tom knows things. He knows things in and out. He likes to quote from Richard Feynman &ldquo;What I cannot create, I do not understand&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s really hard to ask a question that he cannot answer, if that happens, he always dig into it and find the answer eventually.</p>

<p>Tom knows a lot of things. He always stay curious about the world. He respect science, although his work is mostly programming, he also likes math, physics, astronomy. He likes to read all sorts of science articles in his free time. Getting to know how things work makes him excited.</p>

<p>Tom is humble. I think his humble is from Aristotle &ldquo;The more you know, the more you know you don&rsquo;t know&rdquo;.
He think all fields can be as deep as an ocean and only computer science is he only knows the tip
of the iceberg. He never judges something if he don&rsquo;t know enough about it, and that&rsquo;s when he become a quiet
listener.</p>

<p>Tom is open minded. He knows there is no perfect solution but the right solution for the right
time. He never despise something nor does he say something is the best, because he knows there
are always pro and cons. The world is never absolute but only relevant.</p>

<p>Tom is detail oriented. He enjoy the beauty of perfection. He can point out a small misalign on the
web page. When he send messages, keywords are highlighted, background context are included. He like
to think of his work as a work of art, it is the details make the perfection.</p>

<p>Tom is lazy. He remember all sorts of short cuts about the tools he use. He install bunch of plugins. He creates scripts and tools to make his life easier. To him, time is probably too precious to waste.</p>

<p>Tom is cool. He shop apps and tools like we shop cloth. He is generous on spending money for paid apps as
long as he feel it is helpful. He also likes to customize his working environment just like we decorating our home. Theme, fonts, icons are his favorite.</p>

<p>Tom is geeky. He is not a social person and he don&rsquo;t talk to other people that much. A lot of
times, he will focus and live in his own world, but when there is a topic that he is interested
in, he will be the one talking none stop.</p>

<p>Tom is a contributor. He likes to help the community. He answer questions on stack overflow, submit PR for open source projects. He believe in open source and knowledge sharing can make the world
a better place.</p>

<p>Although Tom is the best developer I&rsquo;ve ever known, he never want to be a manager or move one step upward.
Maybe he just don&rsquo;t want to deal with people, because for him, people is more complected then
machine. He enjoy the work he do and he choose to live a simple but enjoyable life, why not?</p>
